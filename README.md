- 👋 Hi, I’m @visskiss
- 👀 I just built my first SwiftUI App, It's available on the App Store now and joins my other three apps. The main aim behind this app was to be
 able to doublecheck the GPS data linked to workouts. Specifically, I noticed my open water swims were neither precise nor accurate, with a 
 typical mile long swim usually measuring between .6 and .7 of the actual distance. When I started digging, I noticed iOS only lets you export 
 the entirety of your health data atomically, which is less than ideal. Enter GPX Workout Pro. Another impetus for this project was my desire to 
 really learn SwiftUI. And I did! Now I love @EnvironmentObjects, @State, and even $bindings!  SwiftUI is also reactive, so the design patterns
 are really completely different. (isPresenting anyone?)
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ....
SwiftUI! I am also thinking of doing my first NodeJS backend.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
I would love to collaborate on building a nodejs backend for a community site for open water swimmers. If you'd like to do that, let me know!
