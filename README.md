- 👋 Hi, I’m @visskiss
- 👀 My latest app is Open Water Swim for Apple Watch and iPhone. It's an open water swim tracker with a gorgeous swiftUi interface.  You can find it at https://apps.apple.com/us/app/open-water-swim/id6444587873 * Specifically, I noticed my open water swims were neither precise nor accurate, with a typical mile long swim usually measuring between .6 and .7 of the actual distance. So I built my own tracker based on GPS. This built somewhat on the knowledge I gained building my first GPS app.
- The first app I built in SwiftUI is GPX workout pro, available at - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gpx-workout-pro/id6443549018 - The main aim behind this app was to be able to doublecheck the GPS data linked to workouts.  When I started digging, I noticed iOS only lets you export the entirety of your health data atomically, which is less than ideal. Enter GPX Workout Pro. Another impetus for this project was my desire to really learn SwiftUI. And I did! Now I love @EnvironmentObjects, @State, and even $bindings!  SwiftUI is also reactive, so the design patterns are really completely different. (isPresenting anyone?)
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ....
SwiftUI! I am also thinking of doing my first NodeJS backend.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
I would love to collaborate on building a nodejs backend for a community site for open water swimmers. If you'd like to do that, let me know!
